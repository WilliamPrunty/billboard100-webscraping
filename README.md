## Webscraping

1. Extract out the This Week, artist, song, Last Week, Peak Position, and Weeks on Chart values from https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/ into a pandas DataFrame.

2. After getting the code working, write a function which will, given a date, return a pandas DataFrame containing the Billboard chart data for that date.
